# NA-replacement

The program takes a data frame as input and replaces its NA entries as following: if type of data is numeric na value of variable is replaced by the mean of the variable #mean(x, na.rm = TRUE), otherwise if the variable type is not numeric (character or factor) mode of the variable is replacing na values. Note that the attached csv file is just for testing.
